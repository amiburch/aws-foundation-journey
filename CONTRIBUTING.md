## Working with draw.io Files

The `.png` images used in this repository are created in the following manner:

1. Open the `.drawio` file of interest using either the free online version or your internal instance the draw.io.
1. Select the tab of interst.
1. Select "Edit -> Select All"
1. Select "File -> Export As -> PNG..."
1. Select "Selection Only" and "Crop".
1. Select "Export"
1. Select "Download"

Copy the exported PNG file to the `images/` folder and rename it to suit your needs.

Since the file name and tab name are used to create the file names of exported images, you can minimize work required to export images by ensuring that the tab names represent what you'd like to use for the image names.  When renaming, you'll just need to remove the file name that is included by default in the export image file name.
