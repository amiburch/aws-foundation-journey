# Custom AWS Account Baselines

Your cloud foundation team will need to define and efficiently roll out new and updated cloud resources or "baselines" across your AWS accounts.  For example, you will likely gain value from:

* Reducing the set of AWS services that development teams can use in their development AWS accounts so that access to services that are likely not important to your business are disallowed.
* Refining the degree of access development teams have in their development AWS accounts. For example, you likely don't want development team members to be able to modify stable foundation team managed resources residing in the development team AWS accounts.

These are just serveral examples of many that are common for organizations starting out with AWS.

As the degree of customization and extent of your foundation resources expands over time, you'll benefit for having an automated means to roll out and manage such resources.  Additionally, you'll benefit from using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and other common practices to treat such resources as code that progresses through a modern development and testing worklow.

**Review Notes: For now add ideas and references to existing publicly available resources**

Let's build up ideas and refine as we go.

## Requirements

*...use the CAF perspectives to represent the typical set of customer requirements...*

## Solution Options and Resources

*...defer to existing documentation including decision trees, blog posts, formal AWS docs, etc. as much as feasible...*
