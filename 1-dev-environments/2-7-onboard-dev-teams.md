# 7. Onboard the Initial Development Teams

In this step your Security and Cloud Admins will onboard a limited set of initial developers who will have access to their team development environment. The outcome is that a small team of developers has the knowledge to start using their AWS development account, where to find basic usage documentation, and who to contact for support.

This step should take about an hour to complete.

* In AWS SSO:
    * Create users and associate them with groups in AWS SSO as necessary to onboard the initial small set of users.
    * Assign the relevant groups to the new AWS account.
* Train the users on how to access the new team development account.
