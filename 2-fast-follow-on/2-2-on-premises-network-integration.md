**Review Notes: For now add ideas and references to existing publicly available resources**

Let's build up ideas and refine as we go.

## Requirements

*...use the CAF perspectives to represent the typical set of customer requirements...*

*...typically start with site-to-site VPN based on speed of set up...*

## Solution Options and Resources

*...defer to existing documentation including decision trees, blog posts, formal AWS docs, etc. as much as feasible...*

*...if the customer started with the use of temporary VPCs in support of their first few development environments, highlight considerations when migrating to the use of a set of new networks to support their development, test, and production environments...*
