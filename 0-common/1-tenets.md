# Tenets

The following tenets or principles help the team make decisions about this collection of guides.

# 1. Customer self-service and scale.

Although it's helpful for many customers to have AWS experienced people working with them in this early stage of adoption, position the detailed guidance so that interested customers can follow it on their own.

# 2. Work in the open.

Engage customers, partners, and others out in the open from the start.  Hook the effort into an external community.

# 3. Take a journey-based approach to providing guidance.

Make the target audience and specific stage of adoption clear throughout the guidance.

Incorporate all guidance into a contiguous experience. Avoid inclusion of guidance and resources that don't fit the story and journey.  Take steps to position all references to other guidance in the content of the contiguous narrative.

# 4. Focus on the common underpinnings or "foundation" aspects of the journey

That apply largely independent of specific workload types and industry verticals.

At least in the early stages of developing this guidance, defer to other resources to address workload- and industry-specific needs.

# 5. Start and focus on early stage of formal adoption of AWS.

Don't boil the ocean. Focus on the early "project" stage of formal adoption of AWS. Provide pathways to other guidance and offerings that help customers through the later "foundation" stage of adoption.

# 6. Focus on the 80% part of 80/20.

Address the most common scnearios first.

# 7. Work with AWS to continually improve the customer experience.

Over time, the detailed guidance should continually reduce in scope as more features are built into the platform.

# 8. Keep apace with latest best practices and AWS capabilities.

As more capabilities are built into the AWS platform and additional best practices are development, ensure that this guidance is kept up-to-date.
