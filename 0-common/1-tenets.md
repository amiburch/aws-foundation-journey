# Tenets

The following tenets or principles guide this collection of guides.

# 1. Customer self-service and scale.

Although it's helpful for many customers to have AWS experienced people working with them in this early stage of adoption, position the detailed guidance so that interested customers can follow it on their own.

# 2. Work in the open.

Engage customers, partners, and others out in the open from the start.  Hook the effort into an external community.

# 3. Take a journey-based approach to providing guidance.

Make the target audience and specific stage of adoption clear throughout the guidance.

Incorporate all guidance into a contiguous experience. Avoid inclusion of guidance and resources that don't fit the story and journey.  Take steps to integrate existing guidance into the narrative.

# 4. Start and focus on early stage of formal adoption of AWS.

Don't boil the ocean. Focus on the early "project" stage of formal adoption of AWS. Provide pathways to other guidance and offerings that help customers through the later "foundation" stage of adoption.

# 5. Work with AWS to continually improve the customer experience.

Over time, the detailed guidance should continually reduce in scope as more features are built into the platform.

# 6. Keep apace with latest best practices and AWS capabilities.

As more capabilities are built into the AWS platform and additional best practices are development, ensure that this guidance is kept up-to-date.
