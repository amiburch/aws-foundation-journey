# Enhanced Security Monitoring and Compliance

This section addresses the need for enhanced security capabilities often required as applications are launched. These capabilities would be less than requiring a custom account baseline ([discussed here](./2-3-custom-account-baselines.md)) but still need to be addressed.

## Examples

* An application requires a named IAM user to access the AWS platform with an API key and secret, configure additional alarms and logs when these credentials are used.
