# Solution Including Fast Follow-On Requirements

The following diagram highlights in green where and how the typical set of fast follow-on requirements can be met. If your organization’s needs dictate that some of these requirements must be satisfied from the start before formal development and testing can occur on AWS, you’ll need to allocate additional time for your initial build out.  The initial build out instructions in this guide refer to additional AWS guides to help you meet these requirements.
