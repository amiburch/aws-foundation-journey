# Federated Access to AWS Platform

---
**Review Notes: For now add ideas and references to existing publicly available resources

Let's build up ideas and refine as we go.

## Requirements

*...use the CAF perspectives to represent the typical set of customer requirements...*

## Solution Options and Resources

*...defer to existing documentation as much as feasible...*

*...if the customer started with the use of locally managed users and groups in AWS SSO, highlight considerations when miograting to the use of external identity providers either via AWS SSO or traditional federated access to AWS outside of AWS SSO...*
